#This is a first experiment at creating an application for learning piano, violin and bass.
#Some long terms goals are:
#Pitch analyzer for violin and bass (analog input)
#Midi input
#Simplifying midi to sheet music
#Playing along
#Turn cards for practicing and guessing scales, clefs, and riffs etc.

#The first version will aim at creating a class for notes, scales and so on.
#The second step will be to show them on an appropriate clef.
#Also simple turn cards
